## 2. Explain the interfacing of 8255 with 8086 in memory-mapped I/O mode with a diagram.

In **memory-mapped I/O**, the 8255 ports are treated as memory locations. The 8086 uses its standard **$\overline{MEMR}$** (Memory Read) and **$\overline{MEMW}$** (Memory Write) control signals for access.

### Interfacing Summary

* **Data Lines ($\mathbf{D_{0}-D_{7}}$):** Connected to the $\mathbf{D_{0}-D_{7}}$ lines of the 8086 bus (lower data byte).
* **Address Lines ($\mathbf{A_{0}, A_{1}}$):** The 8255's $A_0$ and $A_1$ register select lines are connected to the 8086's **$\mathbf{A_{1}}$ and $\mathbf{A_{2}}$** lines, respectively, ensuring the 8255 is mapped to **even-numbered addresses** to align with the 8086's 16-bit word organization.
* **Control Lines:**
    * $\mathbf{\overline{RD}}$ is connected to $8086$'s $\mathbf{\overline{MEMR}}$.
    * $\mathbf{\overline{WR}}$ is connected to $8086$'s $\mathbf{\overline{MEMW}}$.
* **Chip Select ($\mathbf{\overline{CS}}$):** Generated by an **Address Decoder** which monitors the high-order address lines ($\mathbf{A_{3}}$ to $\mathbf{A_{19}}$) to place the 8255 within a specific memory block.



### Address Mapping Example (Base Address $4000\text{H}$)

| Register | $A_{1}$ (8086 $A_{1}$) | $A_{2}$ (8086 $A_{2}$) | Register Select ($A_{1}A_{0}$) | Memory Address |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| Port A | 0 | 0 | 00 | $\mathbf{4000\text{H}}$ |
| Port B | 1 | 0 | 01 | $\mathbf{4002\text{H}}$ |
| Port C | 0 | 1 | 10 | $\mathbf{4004\text{H}}$ |
| CWR | 1 | 1 | 11 | $\mathbf{4006\text{H}}$ |

***

## 3. Explain the format of the Control Word Register (CWR) of 8255 with an example.

The 8-bit CWR is used to select the operating **mode** (Mode 0, 1, or 2) and the **direction** (Input/Output) for the three ports (A, B, C).

| Bit | Name | Function (Mode Set $\mathbf{D_{7}=1}$) |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| $\mathbf{D_{7}}$ | **Mode Set Flag** | Must be **1** for I/O mode definition. |
| $\mathbf{D_{6}, D_{5}}$ | **Mode Selection for Group A** | $\mathbf{00}$ = Mode 0, $\mathbf{01}$ = Mode 1, $\mathbf{1x}$ = Mode 2 |
| $\mathbf{D_{4}}$ | **Port A Direction** | $\mathbf{1}$ = Input, $\mathbf{0}$ = Output |
| $\mathbf{D_{3}}$ | **Port $C_{Upper}$ Direction** | $\mathbf{1}$ = Input, $\mathbf{0}$ = Output |
| $\mathbf{D_{2}}$ | **Mode Selection for Group B** | $\mathbf{0}$ = Mode 0, $\mathbf{1}$ = Mode 1 |
| $\mathbf{D_{1}}$ | **Port B Direction** | $\mathbf{1}$ = Input, $\mathbf{0}$ = Output |
| $\mathbf{D_{0}}$ | **Port $C_{Lower}$ Direction** | $\mathbf{1}$ = Input, $\mathbf{0}$ = Output |

### Example

**Objective:** Program the 8255 for: Port A (Mode 0, Output), Port B (Mode 0, Input), $C_{Upper}$ (Output), $C_{Lower}$ (Input).

| Bit | Value |
| :---: | :---: |
| $\mathbf{D_{7}}$ | 1 |
| $\mathbf{D_{6}, D_{5}}$ | 00 |
| $\mathbf{D_{4}}$ | 0 |
| $\mathbf{D_{3}}$ | 0 |
| $\mathbf{D_{2}}$ | 0 |
| $\mathbf{D_{1}}$ | 1 |
| $\mathbf{D_{0}}$ | 1 |

**Resulting Control Word:** $10000111_2 = \mathbf{87\text{H}}$

## 4. Explain the functional block diagram of 8257 with a neat sketch.

The **8257** DMA Controller manages data transfer between I/O and memory directly, freeing the CPU.



### Key Blocks

1.  **DMA Channels (4):** Each channel (CH0-CH3) has a pair of 16-bit registers: **DMA Address Register** (starting address) and **Terminal Count Register** (number of bytes to transfer).
2.  **Control Logic:** The master controller, handling $\mathbf{\overline{CS}}, \mathbf{\overline{RD}}, \mathbf{\overline{WR}}$, and clock signals, and coordinating bus control.
3.  **Priority Resolver:** Determines which of the four $\mathbf{DRQ}$ (DMA Request) signals gets access to the bus, based on programmed priority (fixed or rotating).
4.  **Address Generation Unit:** During DMA transfer, it uses the contents of the DMA Address Register to drive the 16 address lines ($\mathbf{A_{0}-A_{15}}$).
5.  **Bus Control Signals:** Generates control signals like $\mathbf{\overline{MEMR}}, \mathbf{\overline{MEMW}}, \mathbf{\overline{IOR}, \overline{IOW}}$ to execute the transfer. It also uses $\mathbf{HRQ}$ (Hold Request) to ask the CPU for the bus and waits for $\mathbf{HLDA}$ (Hold Acknowledge).

## 5. Apply the block diagram of 8259 to explain how it interfaces with a CPU.

The **8259 PIC** (Programmable Interrupt Controller) manages up to eight interrupt inputs ($\mathbf{IR_{0}-IR_{7}}$) and routes the highest-priority one to the CPU.



### CPU Interfacing Explanation

The 8259 interfaces with the CPU (e.g., 8086) via three main channels:

1.  **Data Bus Buffer ($\mathbf{D_{0}-D_{7}}$):** Used for two-way communication:
    * CPU $\to$ 8259: To send **Command Words** (ICWs/OCWs) to program its mode and set masks.
    * 8259 $\to$ CPU: To transmit the **Interrupt Vector Number** during an interrupt acknowledge cycle.

2.  **Interrupt Signaling ($\mathbf{INT}$ and $\mathbf{\overline{INTA}}$):**
    * **$\mathbf{INT}$ (Interrupt):** Connected to the CPU's **$\text{INTR}$** pin. Asserted high by the 8259 when a valid, non-masked, pending interrupt is present.
    * **$\mathbf{\overline{INTA}}$ (Interrupt Acknowledge):** Sent by the CPU to the 8259 to acknowledge the $\text{INT}$ request. Upon receiving the first $\overline{INTA}$, the 8259 prepares the vector address. Upon the second $\overline{INTA}$, it places the **vector number** on the data bus.

3.  **Control Logic:** Decodes the $\mathbf{\overline{CS}}, \mathbf{\overline{RD}}, \mathbf{\overline{WR}}, \mathbf{A_{0}}$ signals to manage the flow of command and status words between the CPU and the 8259's internal registers (IRR, IMR, ISR).

## 6. Explain Arhitechure of 80386 with neat diagaram explain each parts of section

The **80386** was the first 32-bit microprocessor from Intel, introducing a fully pipelined architecture and **Protected Mode**.



### Sections and Explanations

The architecture is divided into three parallel units:

1.  **Bus Unit:**
    * **Function:** Manages the external bus interface (32-bit Address Bus, 32-bit Data Bus).
    * **Prefetch Unit:** Fetches instructions ahead of time and stores them in the **Instruction Queue** to keep the pipeline full.

2.  **Central Processing Unit (CPU):**
    * **Instruction Decode Unit:** Translates instructions from the queue into microcode.
    * **Execution Unit:** Contains the **32-bit ALU** and the general-purpose registers (EAX, EBX, etc.). It performs data operations.

3.  **Memory Management Unit (MMU):**
    * **Function:** Crucial for Protected Mode, translating logical addresses and enforcing protection.
    * **Segmentation Unit:** Converts a Logical Address (Selector:Offset) into a **32-bit Linear Address**. Checks segment limits and privilege levels.
    * **Paging Unit:** Converts the Linear Address into a **32-bit Physical Address** (if paging is enabled), using 4KB pages and Page Directory/Tables.
    * **Translation Look-aside Buffer (TLB):** A high-speed cache for storing recent Linear $\to$ Physical address translations, speeding up paging.

***

## 7. Compare the features of the Segmentation Unit and the Paging Unit in the 80386 microprocessor

Both units in the MMU perform address translation and protection in Protected Mode.

| Feature | Segmentation Unit | Paging Unit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Goal** | Provides a **logical view** of memory (Code, Data, Stack) and **segment-level protection**. | Provides **physical memory management** for non-contiguous allocation and **virtual memory**. |
| **Address Input** | **Logical Address** (Selector: Offset). | **Linear Address** (Output of Segmentation). |
| **Address Output** | **Linear Address** (32 bits). | **Physical Address** (32 bits). |
| **Memory Unit Size** | **Variable-size** segments (1 byte to 4 GB). | **Fixed-size** pages (typically **4 KB**). |
| **Mechanism** | Uses **Segment Descriptors** (in GDT/LDT). | Uses **Page Directory** and **Page Tables**. |
| **Mandatory** | **Mandatory** in Protected Mode. | **Optional** (Enabled via the **PG bit** in $CR0$). |

***

## 8. Apply the concept of protection levels in 80386 to explain how the processor ensures operating system security.

The 80386 ensures security via its **Hierarchical Protection Model** based on **four Privilege Levels (Rings 0-3)**.

1.  **Privilege Rings:**
    * **Ring 0 (Highest):** Reserved for the **OS Kernel** (full hardware access).
    * **Ring 3 (Lowest):** Reserved for **User Applications** (restricted access).

2.  **Security Mechanisms:**
    * **Restricted Instructions:** Instructions that can harm the system (e.g., modifying control registers or I/O access) can only be executed when the **Current Privilege Level (CPL)** is Ring 0. A Ring 3 attempt results in a **General Protection Fault (GPF)**.
    * **Segment/Page Protection:** The processor compares the CPL with the privilege level encoded in **Segment Descriptors** and **Page Table Entries**. A program in Ring 3 cannot directly read/write memory or execute code belonging to a higher-privilege ring (e.g., the OS kernel in Ring 0).
    * **Controlled Transitions (Gates):** To request a service from the OS kernel (moving from Ring 3 to Ring 0), a user program must use a **Call Gate**. This is a defined, safe entry point that controls the entry address and ensures only legitimate OS code is executed, preventing arbitrary elevation of privilege.
    * **Address Space Separation:** Paging isolates the user program's memory space from the OS kernel's memory space (via the User/Supervisor bit), ensuring a bug in a user program cannot corrupt the OS.

## 9. Compare 80386, Pentium I, Pentium II.

| Feature | $\mathbf{80386}$ (i386) | $\mathbf{\text{Pentium I}}$ (P5) | $\mathbf{\text{Pentium II}}$ (P6) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Launch Year** | 1985 | 1993 | 1997 |
| **Data Bus Width** | **32-bit** | **64-bit** | **64-bit** |
| **Address Bus Width** | **32-bit** (4 GB) | **32-bit** (4 GB) | **36-bit** (64 GB) |
| **Key Architecture** | **32-bit Protected Mode**, Simple Pipeline. | **Superscalar** (2 parallel pipelines). | **Out-of-Order Execution, Register Renaming, Deep Pipeline** (10-12 stages). |
| **Performance Gain** | 32-bit native processing. | Execute **2 instructions per clock** cycle. | Execute $\sim 3-5$ $\mu \text{ops}$ per clock cycle. |
| **Cache (L1)** | None/External. | $\mathbf{16 \text{KB}}$ total (8KB Data + 8KB Instruction). | $\mathbf{32 \text{KB}}$ total (16KB Data + 16KB Instruction). |
| **L2 Cache** | None/External. | External chip (slower, motherboard). | **Integrated on-package** (faster, on SEC cartridge). |

## 10. Draw the block diagram of Pentium 4 and explain how it works.

The **Pentium 4** used the **NetBurst architecture**, prioritizing high clock speeds via an extremely deep pipeline (**Hyper Pipelined Technology**).



### How it Works (Pipelined Stages)

1.  **Front End:**
    * **Branch Prediction:** Highly critical due to the deep pipeline; it attempts to guess the next instruction address to prevent stalls.
    * **Trace Cache (L1 $\mu \text{op}$ Cache):** Stores **already decoded $\mathbf{\mu \text{ops}}$** in the predicted execution path, bypassing the slow instruction fetch and decode stages for frequently used code.

2.  **Out-of-Order Execution Engine:**
    * The $\mu \text{ops}$ are scheduled for execution based on data availability, not the original program order (**Out-of-Order Execution**). This keeps the execution units constantly busy.
    * **Rapid Execution Engine:** Contains the ALUs that run at **twice the core clock frequency**, accelerating simple integer operations.

3.  **Retirement:**
    * Results are collected and committed back to the processor's main registers in the **original program order** (**In-Order Retirement**), ensuring program correctness.

***

## 11. Explain the concept of Hyper-Threading.

**Hyper-Threading (HT)** is Intel's implementation of **Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT)**, which allows a single physical CPU core to function as two logical processors.

* **Mechanism:** The core **duplicates the architectural state** (registers, instruction pointers, control registers) for two threads, but **shares the majority of the physical execution resources** (ALUs, FPU, cache).
* **Goal (Utilization):** When one logical thread is temporarily stalled (e.g., waiting for data from memory - a "cache miss"), the core can immediately switch to executing instructions from the second logical thread, filling the unused pipeline stages.
* **Benefit:** HT increases the overall utilization of the physical core's execution units. It typically provides a performance boost of **15-30%** in multi-threaded environments, although it does not double performance since resources are shared.

## 12. Explain how a TLB helps in address translation. explain in detail with daigram

The **Translation Look-aside Buffer (TLB)** is a small, high-speed, associative cache that stores recent virtual-to-physical address translations used during the paging process.



### Detailed Explanation

1.  **The Problem:** Without a TLB, every memory access in a paged system requires at least **two memory accesses** just to find the physical address (Page Directory $\to$ Page Table) before the data itself can be fetched. This two-step translation process significantly slows down the CPU.

2.  **TLB Operation:**
    * When the CPU generates a **Linear Address**, the MMU simultaneously checks the TLB to see if the mapping for that virtual page number is present.
    * **TLB Hit:** If the address is found in the TLB (**TLB Hit**), the corresponding **Physical Frame Number (PFN)** is retrieved instantly (typically in one clock cycle). The full page table lookup in slow main memory is bypassed.
    * **TLB Miss:** If the address is not in the TLB, a **TLB Miss** occurs. The MMU then performs the standard, slow two-level page table walk in main memory. Once the physical address is found, the new mapping is written back to the TLB for faster access in the future.

The TLB acts as a **lookup table** for address translations. Since programs often exhibit **locality of reference** (accessing the same memory pages repeatedly), the TLB achieves a very high hit rate (often $>95\%$), making memory access nearly as fast as if paging were not used.
