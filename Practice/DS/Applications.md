## **Module I: Introduction to Data Structures (CO1)**

### **Topics Covered**
- Concept of ADT (Abstract Data Type)  
- Types: Linear and Nonlinear Data Structures  
- Operations on Data Structures (Insertion, Deletion, Searching, Traversal, Sorting)  
- Arrays, Multidimensional Arrays, Array of Pointers  
- String Manipulation  
- *Self-Learning: Structures with pointers*

### **Applications**
1. Arrays are used in image processing (2D arrays for pixels).  
2. String manipulation in text editors, compilers, and pattern matching.  
3. Data storage in databases (tables use array-like structures).  
4. Matrix operations in scientific and engineering applications.  
5. Memory management for static data representation.

### **Advantages**
- Fast access using index (O(1)).  
- Easy to implement and understand.  
- Best for fixed-size homogeneous data.

### **Disadvantages**
- Fixed size (cannot grow dynamically).  
- Insertion and deletion operations are costly (O(n)).  
- Memory wastage if not fully utilized.
